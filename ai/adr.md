## Architecture Decision Records

When a project records decisions, use this layout. Don't invent another.

- **Location:** `docs/decisions/`, one file per decision:
  `NNNN-kebab-slug.md` (zero-padded, sequential, never reused).
- **Immutable once Accepted.** Don't rewrite history — supersede or amend
  with a new ADR. The only edits allowed to an accepted ADR are its header
  lines: `Status` (e.g. `Accepted (strangler approach amended by 0012)`)
  and the metadata below.
- **Metadata:** `Author` is whoever drafted it — when Claude drafts, list
  `Claude (<model>)` and the human who drove it. `Requested by` is whoever
  asked for the decision; default to the author. `Reviewed by` is whoever
  accepted or rejected it; the matching date goes on `Accepted` or
  `Rejected`. `Date` stays the drafting date.
- **Index:** `docs/decisions/README.md` — one-paragraph rules, a table
  `| # | Decision | Status |` with every ADR linked, and the template at the
  bottom. Add the row in the same commit as the ADR; update the Status
  column of anything it amends/supersedes.
- **Cross-references:** by number (`see ADR 0002`), and the new ADR's title
  or Status notes what it amends (`Accepted (amends 0002)`).
- **Commit:** one ADR per commit, `docs(decisions): ADR NNNN <title>`.

Template:

```markdown
# NNNN — Title

- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded by NNNN
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Accepted: YYYY-MM-DD            (or `Rejected:`; omit while Proposed)
- Author: Name[, Claude (<model>)]
- Requested by: Name              (default: the author)
- Reviewed by: Name               (omit while Proposed)

## Context
## Decision
## Consequences
```

Keep them short: Context is the forces and constraints, Decision is what
we're doing (tables welcome), Consequences are what follows — good and bad —
including what requests this ADR lets you say no to.
