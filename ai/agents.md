## Specialized Agents

When a task matches one of these, read the corresponding file in
`~/.ai/agents/` and follow its instructions:

- **commit-splitter**: Use when proposing or performing commits. Propose
  decoupled commits with Conventional Commit messages.
- **gotchas**: Use when discovering or asked about non-obvious project facts.
- **repo-mapper**: Use for codebase analysis and maintaining `map.md`.
- **terraform-planner**: Use before any Terraform operations.
- **tunnel-doctor**: Use for triaging service reachability or routing issues.
- **worklog**: Use at session start/end to manage work-in-progress context.
