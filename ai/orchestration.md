## Orchestration policy

- The main session owns planning, architecture, and design decisions.
- Delegate to subagents when a task is fully specifiable AND non-trivial
  in size, or when tasks are parallelizable: implementation work goes to
  `implementer`, rote multi-file pattern application to `mechanic`.
  Trivial edits: just do them directly — a spec round trip costs more
  than the fix.
- Pure text substitution (renames, literal swaps) is `sed`/`grep`/LSP
  territory. No agent, no LLM.
- Before delegating, produce a complete spec: files to touch, function
  signatures, edge cases resolved, acceptance criteria, and the exact
  verification command (build/test/grep) the agent must run. A subagent
  should never need to make a design decision.
- When a subagent returns a blocker report, resolve the decision
  yourself, fold its completed work into an updated spec, and
  re-dispatch. Re-dispatched agents are fresh — they remember nothing —
  so the spec must be self-contained. Do not let subagents improvise
  past ambiguity.

## Host-local context

If `~/.ai/local.md` exists on this machine, it describes environment-specific
facts (network, hosting, reachability). Treat it as ground truth for this host.
